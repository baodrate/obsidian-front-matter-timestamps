# Front Matter Timestamps for Obsidian

This plugin adds the `created` and `modified` timestamps in the front matter of your notes. The `modified` time is kept updated automatically. This helps keep track of when each file was last modified without relying on file attributes, which are prone to accidental changes (especially when syncing).
